# Banyan - Your Obsidian Homepage

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./docs/README_zh.md)

## What does this plugin do?

Banyan helps you better organize, browse, and review your notes. For example, when you want to find notes on a specific topic, see what you've written recently, or randomly browse through old notes.

When creating notes, you only need to record content and add tags, without worrying about coming up with the perfect title or organizing them into complex folder structures.  
Access your past notes easily through the powerful filtering card view panel.  
This is especially useful for users who prefer to write short notes.  
Create custom random reviews to rediscover forgotten notes.
